#### description
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

```js
arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
```
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

```js
arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
```

#### solution
```js
function arrayDiff(a, b) {
    return a.reduce((acc, curr) => {
        return !b.includes(curr) ? [...acc, curr] : acc
    }, []);
}
```

#### descriptions

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given `n`, take the sum of the digits of `n`. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

##### Examples
```plains
    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2
```
#### solutions
```js
function digital_root(n) {
    let sum = 0;
    let curr = n;
    do {
        sum += curr % 10;
        curr = Math.floor(curr / 10);
    } while (curr !== 0)
    return sum >= 10 ? digital_root(sum) : sum;
}
```
